                                I'm a front end developer, user experience designer and graduate student at the University of Washington in the Human Centered Design & Engineering program.
                            <p>

                            <p>My concentration is on user centered design and rapid prototyping -- specializing in both 2D and 3D environments. I am expected to graduate in June 2017.</p>

                            <p>My ideology in life best aligns with the work of Bertrand Russell. There is no hierarchy between the pursuit of love and knowledge -- and that's how I try to live my life. I'm an amateur photographer, writer, traveler (backpacked through India, Mexico) and burgeoning yogi.</p>

                        <h3 class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-typography--headline">Design Process</h3>

                        <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col mdl-card__supporting-text no-padding ">
                            <h4>1. Explore</h4>
                            <p>
                                I've been rigorously taught to incorporate the UCD process -- the user centered design method -- into everything that I do. Research is the foundation for all things, and often times, many people overlook the importance of it for the "quick and dirty" wireframes. Through traditional qualitative methods, IDEO cards, discovering pain points, user scenarios, creating personas, surveys, storyboarding, etc, I try to understand the user as much as possible. Beyond the traditional UCD method, I am an advocate for exploration in research to foster creativity and innovation.
                            </p>
                            <h4>2. Ideate</h4>
                            <p>
                                There is nothing more crucial than feedback through the design lifecycle. I welcome the negative, the positive, the shouting, the calm and collected and collaborativeness of it all. UX is the wild west of tech, and it is only through teamwork and feedback from an awesome team and our kickass users, that we can learn what we need to change. I'm all about change (I once moved three cities in three years). Forward, onward and keep ideating until you get it right for the user.
                            </p>
                            <h4>3. Empathy</h4>
                            <p>
                                Somebody once told me to be kind, be humble and confident -- but the most important one on that list is to be kind. I try my best to empathize with the user as much as possible. Ask the right questions, find the pain points. Fix them, impove it and make it work.
                            </p>
                            <h4>4. Execute</4>
                            <p>
                                I am a fan of collaborative tools that makes it easy to share among a team and tools that allow you to both wireframe, prototype and code effortlessly. From the Adobe suite, Sketch, Bootstrap, to pure javascript, I know how to make a pen and paper sketch come alive and get it into the user's hands for a usability test.
                            </p>
                            <h4>5. Delight</h4>
                            <p>
                                Last but certainly not least, I aim to delight my customers. Humor has always been a part of my life (former Conan O'Brian monologue intern!) and I believe not only in the functionality of a product, but the delight factor as well.
