    <h3>Research Question:</h3>
    <p>How might we make Gould Hall a responsive environment as a social commentary?</p>
    <h3>About:</h3>
    <p>@SpottedAtGould looked to make Gould Hall, the architecture building at the University of Washington, more responsive to it's inhabitants. Carolyn and I wanted to use cameras and social media as a way to let Gould Hall react to the people in the building.</p>
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <p>This installation represents the interconnectedness of reality and social media. This project suggests that no one was really in Gould Hall unless they were spotted and tweeted. It plays on sites that once were popular on college campuses and in local newspapers where people can share missed love connections<p>by saying that they spotted x person at y location.</p>

    <p>Now, instead of having a person to have to post or send in a description, the building it self can send and post "spotted at Gould" messages to the Internet.</p> 

    <p>See who was spotted at Gould Hall on Twitter.</p>
