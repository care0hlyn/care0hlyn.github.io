    <h3>Research Question:</h3>
    <p>How might we make Gould Hall a responsive environment as a social commentary?</p>
    <h3>About:</h3>
    <p>@SpottedAtGould looked to make Gould Hall, the architecture building at the University of Washington, more responsive to it's inhabitants. Carolyn and I wanted to use cameras and social media as a way to let Gould Hall react to the people in the building.</p>
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <p>This installation represents the interconnectedness of reality and social media. This project suggests that no one was really in Gould Hall unless they were spotted and tweeted. It plays on sites that once were popular on college campuses and in local newspapers where people can share missed love connections<p>by saying that they spotted x person at y location.</p>

    <p>Now, instead of having a person to have to post or send in a description, the building it self can send and post "spotted at Gould" messages to the Internet.</p> 

    <p>See who was spotted at Gould Hall on Twitter.</p>

    <h3>How does this work?</h3>
    <p>Using Arduino, a pressure sensor, sonar sensor, Processing, web cam and a computer, a user walks towards the webcam and the photo screen displayed on the monitor becomes more or less pixelated depending on the distance of the user and the webcam. Once the user steps on the the mat, the pressure sensor is triggered and a picture of the user is sent automatically towards Twitter, where a live feed is currently being hosted at @SpottedAtGould.</p>

    <h3>Arduino Code:</h3>
    <pre><code>
        unsigned long dur = 200L;
        unsigned int freq = 100;

        void setup() {
            // put your setup code here, to run once:
            pinMode(12,OUTPUT);
            pinMode(7, INPUT_PULLUP);
            Serial.begin(9600);
        }

        void loop() {
              // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
            freq = analogRead( A0 );
            Serial.print('d');
            Serial.println(freq);
            if( freq < 200 ){
               tone(12,freq);
               delay(400);
               noTone(12);
            }
            //freq=freq+1;
            delay(500);

            if (!digitalRead(7)) {
             Serial.println('s');
              tone(12, freq + 1000);
                 delay(400);
               noTone(12);
            }
