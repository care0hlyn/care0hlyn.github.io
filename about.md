# tech

> My name is [Carolyn Huynh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolynkimhuynh/) and I'm a User Experience Designer and a recovering web developer.

> My expertise is in enterprise software, developer tools, cybersecurity, and visualizing machine learning. 

> I love to influence the API, and build products that bridges the relationship between UX & eng.

> Been in tech for 7+ years (not including teen years making Xanga layouts via scripting in the browser). I've done the gamut of start-ups, agencies, government work, big tech, incubators, UX/UI, front end engineering, and product development.

> Based in Seattle, but have made memories in San Francisco, Portland, and Los Angeles.

# education

> B.A. Journalism and Public Affairs / Seattle University

> M.S. Human Centered Design & Engineering / University of Washington

> [In-progress] Certificate in Cybersecurity / University of Washington

> [In-progress] MFA Creative Writing & Poetics / University of Washington Bothell

# life outside pixels 

> Outside of UX, I love film photography, my pet rabbit Nimbus 2000, reading fiction, writing essays, watching K-dramas, going on walks of all kinds, and traveling to far away places, and ones close to home.
