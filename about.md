# tech

> My name is [Carolyn Huynh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolynkimhuynh/) and I'm a User Experience Designer and a recovering web developer.

> My expertise is in enterprise software, developer tools, cybersecurity, and visualizing machine learning. 

> I love to influence the API, and build products that bridges the relationship between UX & eng.

> Been in tech for roughly 7+ years (not including the teen years making Xanga layouts via scripting in javascript in the browser). I've done the gamut of start-ups, web development, UX/UI, and product development.

# education

> M.S. Human Centered Design & Engineering / University of Washington

> [In-progress] Certificate in Cybersecurity / University of Washington

# life outside pixels 

> Outside of UX, I love film photography, my pet rabbit Nimbus 2000, reading fiction, writing essays, watching K-dramas, going on walks of all kinds, and working on my skincare line.
